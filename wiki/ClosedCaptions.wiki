= Introduction =
Closed captions need to be enabled in your Team Fortress 2 settings (`closecaption "1"`). Currently, only English is supported. Once the captions are finalized (meaning the HUD comes out of beta), the source will be released with the HUD (requires Source SDK to export).

= Colors =
Color-coding is used to indicate source of sound (generally representing a class). The following is the color key:
