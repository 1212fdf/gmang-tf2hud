#summary Explanation of the closed captioning system.

= Introduction =

 * *This page will be finished by tonight.*

Closed captions need to be enabled in your Team Fortress 2 settings (`closecaption "1"`). Currently, only English is supported. Once the captions are finalized (meaning the HUD comes out of beta), the source will be released with the HUD (requires Source SDK to export).

= Colors =
Color-coding is used to indicate source of sound (generally representing a class). These colors are...
 * <font color="ffa0ff">Possible Uber Cover</font>
 * <font color="fa64fa">Full Uber Declaration</font>
 * <font color="ff00ff">Ubercharge Activation</font>
 * <font color="00ffff">Scout</font>
 * <font color="72d746">Soldier</font>
 * <font color="ff8000">Pyro</font>
 * <font color="a35b40">Demoman</font>
 * <font color="fbaf87">Heavy</font>
 * <font color="ffff00">Engineer</font>
 * <font color="ff0060">Medic</font>
 * <font color="b9b9b9">Sniper</font>
 * <font color="a500ff">Spy</font>
