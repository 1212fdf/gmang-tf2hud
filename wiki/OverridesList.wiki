#summary Listing of all ClientScheme Overrides.

= Introduction =

*When using Overrides, it's very important that you frequently make backup copies of your ClientScheme file, as it's replaced frequently in updates (both HUD and TF2), and typos as small as forgetting a quotation mark can break your game interface entirely.*

For instructions on applying Overrides, see [http://code.google.com/p/gmang-tf2hud/wiki/Settings Settings].

= Override List =
Information about each override is written after slashes (`//`) on the same line.
